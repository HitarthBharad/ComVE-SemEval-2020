# ComVE-SemEval-2020

In this Repo, I have worked on the [ComVE] shared task that was part of SemEval-2020. The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason.

## Objectives

The learning objectives of this projects are to:

1. combine and pre-process two input texts for a text maching problem
2. combine and pre-process a context with several possible answers for a multiple choice problem
3. pre-trained language models for both tasks

## Setup your environment and prepare data

To install the libraries required for this assignment run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

or in case you work with macOS:

    pip install -r requirements-macos.txt

Clone the MeasEval repository:
